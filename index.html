                <p><strong>Lesson 3.3</strong> is a Lesson Day where students explore the counter-intuitive "context problem"—that sometimes providing MORE context makes AI output WORSE. Through analyzing two hummingbird passages, students learn strategic sequencing (building accurate foundations first, then transforming), make nuanced decisions about context inclusion/exclusion, and recognize their personal expertise as a tool for editorial judgment. This lesson emphasizes analytical thinking, recognizing tradeoffs, and strategic decision-making.</p>
